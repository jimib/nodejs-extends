# Extends String, Array, Object...

It should be noted that this only binds helper methods as static methods (not instance!!!)

# Additional Classes

I make use of uberclass, but this is not a strict dependence. If your project has uberclass it will be extended to include EventEmitterClass which can be binded to for events.
